# json-resume2altacv

`json-resume2altacv` is a tool to convert [json-resume](https://jsonresume.org/) schema to [AltaCV](https://github.com/liantze/AltaCV) template.

It was built as a standalone helper for my [personal website](https://github.com/eitchtee/eitchtee.github.io), as a faster way to build my CV as a PDF file, removing the necessity to do it all by hand and keeping a 1:1 partiy with the information on the website, and due to that it is tailored for my needs.

It isn't fully compatible with the json-resume schema and may require extra attributes not present on the schema to work properly.

Feel free to change the code as you see fit.
