# json-resume2altacv

`json-resume2altacv` is a tool to convert json-resume schema to AltaCV template.

It was built as a standalone helper for my [personal website](https://github.com/eitchtee/eitchtee.github.io) and due to that is tailored for my needs.

It isn't fully compatible with the json-resume schema and may require extra attributes not present on the schema to work properly.

Feel free to change the code to fit your needs.
